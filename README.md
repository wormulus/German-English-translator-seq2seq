# German-English-translator-seq2seq
seq2seq German/English Translator

Used tensorflow + keras to make a seq2seq translator <br>
Used Google Colab for final version <br>
Uploaded a smaller .txt file for it to use to avoid github file size limits if needed. Program when run locally w/full training is more accurate than the smaller training. Also uploaded the .zip file of the full text.

Here are some of the translation results.
